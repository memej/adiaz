            <h2>Avoid Viruses Entirely!</h2>
            <ol>
                <li id = "point">Install Anti-Virus Software</li>
                <p>Anti-virus protection is a very important step in keeping a device virus-free because it prevents and protects the user from malware and other dangerous softwares.</p>
                <li id = "point">Keep Your Anti-Virus Software Up to Date</li>
                <p>Making sure the Anti-Virus Software is up to date is important because it gives the latest protection against new and up and coming viruses out there. PSA: Windows users have a free Anti-Virus software with the purchase of their Windows license.</p>
                <liid = "point">Run Regularly Scheduled Scans with Your Anti-Virus Software</li>            
                <p>Make sure to run regular scans to make sure the device is safe. Many users tend to turn their computer off so it is never able to scan. Make sure to give it time!</p>
                <li id = "point">Keep Your Operating System Current</li>
                <p>Keep the operating system up to date to make sure that all the new security patches that fix and plug security leaks are installed. Keeping it up to date can make it harder for viruses and malware to make its way onto the hard drive.</p>
                <li id = "point">Secure Your Network</li>
                <p>Use only secure networks to make sure that no one can access your files. Use only WPA or WPA2 since they have the strongest encryption. Try to avoid WEP and open Wi-Fi since it doesn't have strong enough encryption or any at all for the protection needed for the expert hackers out there.</p>
                <li id = "point">Think Before You Click</li>
                <p>Avoid websites that provide pirated material and opening up random links! Hover over the link before to make sure you are going where you want. Finally, don't download a file from the internet without scanning it before running it. Some Anti-Virus software will scan the file automatically, but that is not always the case.</p>
                <li id = "point">Keep Your Personal Information Safe</li>
                <p>Many hackers don't get into your accounts through brute force. Many of them will search through social media after social media collecting enough information until they get enough personal data to get your account information. Never use real names on discussion boards and max out your privacy settings.</p>
                <li id = "point">Use Multiple Strong Passwords</li>
                <p>Never use the same password! Using the same username and password will make it easier for the hacker to hack multiple accounts and it will only take seconds to do. While making passwords never use dates or pet names!!</p>
