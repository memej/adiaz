            <h2>Viruses Are No Joke</h2>
           <p>Viruses are malicious codes or programs that are designed to alter the way systems operate and its main goal is to spread from one device to another.</p>
           <p>They are just like biological viruses because they replicate and execute themselves with the "host" (computer user) not knowing.</p>
           <p>They harm the system by corrupting or destroying data within random areas of the system. This can cause the system to become obsolete over time.</p>
