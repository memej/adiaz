                <li id = "point">Step 1: Enter Safe Mode</li>
                <p>Disconnect from the internet, and avoid using it until you are sure the PC is clean. Turn on Safe Mode. This will make sure that the only minimum required programs are loaded in. To turn on Safe Mode hit the Start Button and select the Power button, but don't click it. Hold down the Shift key and click Reboot. Select Troubleshooting then Advanced Options then Startup Settings and finally click Restart. After this a menu to open Safe mode will appear. Once in Safe Mode if the computer is noticeably faster you probably have a malware infection or a lot of files to clean up.</p>
                <li id = "point">Step 2: Delete Temporary Files</li>
                <p>Open up Disk Cleanup and clean up the temporary files</p>
                <li id = "point">Step 3: Download Malware Scanners</li>
                <p>Running a malware scanner should be able to remove the infection. Use a different Anti-Virus software than you own because the original software was not able to detect the infection.</p>
                <li id = "point">Step 4: Run a Scan with Malwarebytes</li>
                <p>If you are disconnected from the internet because of Safe Mode exit it just to install and update Malwarebytes then disconnect again. Run the program and scan for the infection (if Malwarebytes automatially closes then the infection may be more serious because it won't allow scanners). Once the scan is complete Malwarebytes will prompt to remove the found infections. To be safe run a full scan with Malwarebytes, it may take longer to complete.</p>
                <li id = "point">Step 5: Fix Your Web Browser</li>
                <p>Check the homepage and connection settings for your browser to make sure it opens up right.</p>
                <li id = "point">Step 6: Recover Your Files If Windows Is Corrupt</li>
                <p>If the malware can't be removed then reinstalling Windows is probably the way to go. Before wiping your hard drive, copy all of your files to an external drive for safe keeping. Once everything is backed up reinstall Windows.</p>
